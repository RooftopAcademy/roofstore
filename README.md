## About the project

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Description

Rooftore was born from the idea of the frontend's group, in the Bootcamp Alpha of Rooftop Academy. We got our inspiration from Mercado Libre, the #1 ecommerce in Latin America.

This project has been created with educational purposes, where we put into practice our skills acquired trough our learning journey, and to be shown as part of our portfolio.
